      <li><span class="bold">He dropped out of high school a while after his grandmother died, and lived in his car</span></li>
      <li><span class="bold">Eventually, he got a job at Taco Bell and worked there for a while, until he realized that he wanted more than that.</span></li>
      <li>He enrolled in the cheapest state university he could find to study liberal arts, started doing odd jobs as a newspaper reporter and giving tuition to homeschoolers.<span class="bold"></span></li>
      <li><span class="bold">During the early 2000s, he enrolled in an international graduate program and travelled to China, where he studied and worked as a teacher for four years. </span>
      <li><span class="bold">When he was 26, he returned to America with his wife and got a job as a school director for an intensive English program on a university campus.</span>
      <li><span class="bold">At age 31, he started learning to code using free online courses and attending hackathons.</span>

        <p class="quote">"freeCodeCamp is my effort to correct the extremely inefficient and circuitous way I learned to code. I'm committing my career and the rest of my life towards making this process as efficient and painless as possible. All those things that made learning to code a nightmare to me are things that we are trying to fix with freeCodeCamp."</p>
